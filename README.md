# Long-Distance-Relationship-App
An app that allows couples to interact and play mini games with each other.

Why did I build this?
I am in a long distance relationship and recognise the struggles it can present, especially if one/both of the people involved have limited access to technology such as consoles/laptops etc. This app aims to solve that problem with the use of just a website.

Initially I wanted to create this as a smartphone application with messaging features and mini games but I need more experience with JavaScript and React before doing this.

Therefore the new scope is just a website that couples can log into and it will recognise if they are logged in at the same time. It will present options that they can press. 

Languages involved:
JavaScript
React

User stories:
Register and couple up
Couples stored on database
When one person logs in, the other person gets an email/notif 
Will allow two people to interact with each other on the website when they are both logged in
Shows online/offline status
If one person is not logged in, then if an option is selected, a pop up is shown and email/notif sent to the person saying they missed that option
E.g. "You missed X's hug!"
Options given:
- Virtual Hug
- Virtual nap
- Virtual game (extended version)
