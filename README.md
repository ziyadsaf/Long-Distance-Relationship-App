# Long-Distance-Relationship-App
An app that allows couples to interact and play mini games with each other.

Why did I build this?
I have been in a long distance relationship (which will no longer be long distance in the near future!) and recognised the struggles it can present, especially if one/both of the people involved have limited access to technology such as consoles/laptops etc. This app aims to solve that problem with the use of just your smartphone. 

It will involve being able to communicate in a unique way, play games with each other on a single app, send reminders to each other and be able to share a calendar together. These are just the preliminary features.

Languages involved:
JavaScript
React

I am aiming to start this after being getting to the finishing stages of my quiz app and my music app.
